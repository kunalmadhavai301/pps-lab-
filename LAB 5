In the Following code of lab 4 we used to find the number given by the user wheather it is present between 10 to 20 or not ..
To perform that function we used to declare the input from the user .
Therefore in this code we used to take the integer num as a input.
To perform that function we used If Else statement .
And to check the number from 10 to 20 we used the logical opertor i.e. "&&" operator to perform the function..
