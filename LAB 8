In the simple code of lab 8 we just simply want to perform to check the given integer by the user is positive or negative..
To execute that code we simply used the greater than equal to sign to execute that program...
And we also used to take the Integer as a input from the user..
And use cout function to print the integer weather it is even or odd.
